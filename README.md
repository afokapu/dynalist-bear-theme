# dynalist-bear-theme

I really love Dynalist. I've tried using Bear over the years tons of times, as I really love the UI,
but really can't get into the "page oriented" workflow, where it's almost mandatory to put tags for organization... it doesn't really work the way my mind works, and I'm more likely to misplace notes.

Dynalist works optimally for me... but they don't have as pretty a design as Bear.

I've created this for myself, attempting to adapt the colors & design of the default Bear theme (slate) for Dynalist.

You can use this CSS by becoming a pro dynalist user, going into settings, going into the Dynalist Pro tab, finding the CSS box, and pasting the CSS from main.css directly in.

You should consider this a work in progress. 

I've mostly have done for myself, but I've love to take pull requests.
